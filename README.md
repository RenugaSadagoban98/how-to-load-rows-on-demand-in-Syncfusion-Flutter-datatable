## Load more button

Showing load more button is an approach that can be used to load more rows to the datagrid by tapping a button that you load from the [SfDataGrid.loadMoreViewBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_datagrid/latest/datagrid/SfDataGrid/loadMoreViewBuilder.html) builder. The button will be loaded when vertical scrolling is reached at the end of the datagrid.

This application demonstrates how to load more rows at runtime when datagrid reaches the bottom in [Syncfusion Flutter DataGrid](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_datagrid) widget.
